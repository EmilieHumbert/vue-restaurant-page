    <p class="aboutTonkotsu">Tonkotsu ramen is a ramen dish that originated in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture
      on the Kyushu island of Japan, and it is a specialty dish in both Fukuoka and Kyushu. The soup broth is
      based on pork bones and other ingredients, which are typically boiled for several hours, and the dish is
      traditionally topped with sliced pork belly and served with ramen noodles that are hard in the center.
      In Fukuoka, Japan, tonkotsu ramen is referred to as Hakata ramen.</p>
